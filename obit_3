Jacob Dobry, 47, passed away peacefully in his sleep on Sunday, August 3rd, 2024.  Those who gathered report he died with a smile on his face.
	Jacob was born on May 4th, 1977 in a small town to parents who loved him.  He is survived by his estranged wife, Mallory Dolbry and he is survived by you, his ever-hating daughter.
	He told you he joined the church at Christmas.  He told you he planned to give Us his mind over mashed potatoes and dry turkey.  He had to explain it to you, to describe the incredible meetings he’d been to, the process of cranial insertion.  He tried to describe the beautiful void of connection and love shared without walls, but you wouldn’t listen.  
	Mallory called you selfish.  Jacob called you nothing at all.  By then he was no longer just himself.
	You never really spoke to him again.
	You see Us as grotesque.  Unnatural.  As though you yourself are not composed of four billion odd neurons.  Where do you end and your pieces begin?
A service will be held to honor the life of Jacob Dolbry on September 17, 2024 at 4pm in the same old church he and Mallory were married.
	We will be there.
	We will be waiting for you.
