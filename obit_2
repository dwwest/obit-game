Jacob Dobry, 47, passed away peacefully in his sleep on Sunday, August 31rd, 2024.  Those who gathered report he died with a smile on his face, though you doubt their word.
	Jacob was born on May 4th, 1977 in a small town to parents who loved him.  He is survived by his loving wife of 24 years, Mallory Dobry neé Nesbitt, and you, his daughter.
	Jacob worked for many years in the financial industry.  In the five years before his death, he devoted himself to the Church of the Mind, becoming a pillar of the spiritual community.  You didn't know he'd joined the Church of the Mind for many years.  Not until it was too late.  Those who knew Jacob described him as happy and hardworking, good and strong.  Your own mother called him “bottled up."  Her mother called him, “just a man, what did you expect?” You called him unstable.  He called you a worry wart.
	A service will be held to honor the life of Jacob Dolbry on September 17, 2024 at 4pm in the same old church he used to take you.
